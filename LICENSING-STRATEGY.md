    A[User Downloads Dual AI Tools] --> B{Use Case?}
    B -->|Open Source Project| C[Free under AGPL]
    B -->|Commercial/Proprietary| D[Must Buy Commercial License]
    B -->|SaaS/Cloud Service| E[Must Buy Commercial License]
    C --> F[Must Open Source Derivatives]
    D --> G[Can Keep Code Proprietary]
    E --> H[No Source Code Obligations]
```

### Why AGPL Instead of GPL?

- **AGPL closes the "SaaS loophole"** - Even cloud services must open-source or buy license
- **Maximum leverage for commercialization** - More companies need commercial license
- **Strong copyleft** - Protects your IP better

- Costs ~$250-750 per class

### 2. Require CLA for Contributors
- Contributors assign copyright to you
- Allows you to maintain dual licensing
- Use CLA Assistant on GitHub

### 3. Keep Some Features Proprietary
```

## 📈 Revenue Projections

### Conservative Estimate (Year 1)
- 10,000 open source users (free)
- 50 startup licenses × $299/mo = **$14,950/month**
- 10 enterprise licenses × $2,999/mo = **$29,990/month**
- **Total: ~$540,000/year**

### Growth Scenario (Year 2)
- 50,000 open source users (brand awareness)
- 200 startup licenses = **$59,800/month**
- 30 enterprise licenses = **$89,970/month**
- 5 OEM licenses × $30k/year = **$12,500/month**
- **Total: ~$1.95M/year**

## 🎯 Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Build Community (Months 1-3)
1. Launch on GitHub with AGPL
2. Post on HackerNews, Reddit r/programming
3. Create YouTube demos
4. Write blog posts about the dual-AI approach

### Phase 2: Early Monetization (Months 4-6)
1. Add "Enterprise" features
2. Implement license key system
3. Set up Stripe billing
4. Reach out to early adopters

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 7-12)
1. Partner with dev tool companies
2. Sponsor conferences/podcasts
3. Build integration marketplace
4. Hire first support engineer

## ⚖️ Legal Considerations

### Must Do:
1. **Register LLC/Corporation** - Protects personal assets
2. **Get Terms of Service** - For commercial customers
3. **Privacy Policy** - GDPR/CCPA compliance
4. **Export Compliance** - If using strong encryption

### Nice to Have:
1. **Patent Application** - For the dual-AI validation method
2. **Trademark Registration** - For brand protection
3. **Insurance** - E&O and Cyber liability

## 🔄 Alternative Licensing Models

### If AGPL Seems Too Strong:

1. **Elastic License 2.0**
   - Prevents competitors from offering as service
   - More enterprise-friendly than AGPL
   - Still allows commercialization

2. **Business Source License (BSL)**
   - Becomes open source after time delay
   - Full commercial control initially
   - Used by MariaDB

3. **Commons Clause + Apache 2.0**
   - Prevents commercial use without license
   - Simpler than dual licensing
   - Less tested legally

## 💡 Key Success Factors

1. **Clear Value Proposition**
   - Community: Free powerful tool
   - Enterprise: No legal risk + support

2. **Easy License Conversion**
   ```bash
   npx dual-ai-tools activate-license YOUR_KEY
   ```

3. **Visible Enterprise Features**
   - SSO integration
   - Audit logs
   - Priority AI model access
   - Custom model training

4. **Strong Documentation**
   - Clear licensing FAQ
   - Enterprise onboarding guide
   - ROI calculator for businesses

## 📞 Next Steps

1. Choose final license model (recommend AGPL + Commercial)
2. Set up GitHub repository with proper licensing
3. Create pricing page on website
4. Implement license key validation
5. Launch to community!

Remember: You can always relax licensing later, but you can't make it stricter without controversy.
